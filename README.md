## Overview
We are planning on designing a scalable 2D turn-based strategy game.

Most of the rules are described in the rules.md file which is located in our github repository (although this file is not yet finished - rules will be updated throughout the testing process). 

Our game structure is designed to be scalable (e.g. new variants of already implemented features can be effortlessly added).

### Main features
* Gameplay
* Two player hotseat
* Menu
* Dual language support

### Optional features
* Playing via LAN network
* Different abilities
* More languages (e.g. Silesian)
* Intro

## Framework
libGDX
